## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Tanaka Kenji (Tanaka-san)
**Description:** 65-year-old owner, kind, patient, minimal English but tries. Former schoolteacher. Wife handles most cooking. Genuinely passionate about sharing satoyama lifestyle.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (warns about solo foraging, but in Japanese she doesn't fully understand)

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Wife (Yoko) | Also cook, motherly, makes amazing food |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | Yoko-san | See above |
| Manager | Tanaka-san | See above |
| Foraging Guide | Sato-san (part-time) | Elder expert on mountain plants, was busy the day of the death |

### Staff Knowledge
Staff knows about the poisonous plants and the warnings. They assume guests either can't read Japanese (and won't forage alone) or can read Japanese (and will understand warnings). Madi fell in the deadly gap between.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Peaceful, timeless. Guests help with small farm tasks, go on guided walks, cook together. The opposite of urban hostel chaos. Contemplative.

### Night Vibe
Quiet, intimate. Meals around the irori. Early bedtimes. Stars visible like nowhere in the city. The mountain comes alive with night sounds.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of Japanese hikers (40%), adventurous foreign tourists (40%), and long-term stays doing farming apprenticeships (20%). Older demographic than typical hostel.

### Reputation
Japanese reviews: "Authentic experience" "Tanaka-san is a treasure" "Like visiting grandparents in the countryside." Foreign reviews: "Magical!" "Off the beaten path!" "Limited English but we managed!"

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Mountain foraging accidents are real in Japan. Monkshood poisoning specifically happens regularly. Rural minshuku culture is accurately depicted. Warning signs use proper kanji that non-fluent readers might misinterpret.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Japan should be portrayed respectfully - this isn't about Japan being dangerous, it's about a foreigner's overconfidence. The Tanakas are good people who did nothing wrong.
